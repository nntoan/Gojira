GoJIRA, a PHP client for JIRA
================================================

GoJIRA is a PHP client for JIRA based on [Symfony2][1] components:

Gojira works with PHP 5.5.9 or later and is heavily inspired by the [Silex][2]
web micro-framework by Fabien Potencier.

## Why this name?

From JIRA team, I think it's funny :)

> Like all good names in the software industry, it started as an in-house code name.

> We originally used Bugzilla for bug tracking and the developers in the office started calling it by the Japanese name for Godzilla, Gojira (the original black-and-white Japanese Godzilla films are also office favourites). As we developed our own bug tracker, and then it became an issue tracker, the name stuck, but the Go got dropped - hence JIRA!

> Further investigation into the name has revealed that Gorira is Japanese for "gorilla", whilst Kujira is Japanese for "whale". So Gojira is roughly translated to mean "gorilla the size of a whale"! (Thanks to yusuke_arclamp â€” Oct 2002)
  
> For those who care - it sounds best if you yell it loudly, as though charging into battle. C'mon - try it!
